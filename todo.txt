I don't keep track of update times anymore because I don't feel like it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[General]
* do I need header/footer on any other screen?
* fix all hardcoded strings; grab them from languages file instead
 * any others?
* use a monospaced font for the clock.
* regen Mentone as Doubleres

[Theme Preferences]
* implement gameplay footer (ScreenGameplay)

[Player Options]
* implement screen filter

[ScreenSelectStyle]
* rework this for gametypes
 * para (versus)
 * techno, pop'n, others?

[ScreenSelectMusic]
 * stage display doesn't show "Final" on final stage
 * per-player SegmentDisplay from moonlight (above percent score if possible)
post v1.0:
 * BPMDisplay for steps-based TimingData

[ScreenGameplay]
* allow for ticks on judgments?
* lifebar does not work on DirectX for some reason
* add screen cover option

[ScreenEvaluation]
* add something to the other side of the DetailsFrame stuff. but what?
  current suggestions include:
  * bonus bars (stream, voltage, air, freeze, chaos)
* wrapwidthpixels on the player mods (currently untested)
* Stage number is broken in non-event mode
